First item for this page appearance customization: which starting theme should
I choose?

I have basically two requests: in the first place I would like to choose an
amazing theme, one that I like as it is and I can use without touching nothing,
so I can spend all of my time writing the contents (posts, images and of course
metapages and plugins) and enjoy its look at the same time. On the other I
would like to be able to customize everything.

Really, it seems like I'm desiring to completely opposite things, but it's not:
I don't want to **have to spend** my time in customizing the aspect, but I
would like to do it if I wish at any time and in any corner.

However, I admit that it's hard the same to have the two things together
(usually amazing themes are also a little bit complicated, but this really
depends on personally tastes affecting the LHS of the arrow), but I decide for
a temporary solution: fix a fully customizable starting point and arrive to a
target theme tweaking the first one.

For the moment I decided to start from [a bulma based
one](https://www.csrhymes.com/bulma-clean-theme/page-with-contents/), since
[bulma](https://bulma.io/) is pretty much the only css framweork I'm little
familiar with, so this means that it's really my *customizable starting point*.

As the target I decided another minimal but beautiful theme, namely [Moon
theme](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/) by Taylan Tatly. It's not so much
complicate, there are really few elements, and this makes the target achievable
even for a novice like me, but from my point of view it's the same a pretty
good target to achieve.

Summing up:

**PRO**
- I'm starting from a theme I expect to be familiar with, so it makes it easier
  to begin tweaking it for my aims
- if I will succeed I will obtain a theme I will be perfectly familiar with for
  further customization and occasional unavoidable fixes

**CONTRA**
- time effort
- javascript: bulma is a pure css framework, that means no javascript... at
  all! I'm completely not familiar with javascript, so I will definitely need
  to put some effort in doing that on my own, even if I will try to limit
  javascript as much as possible

See you soon (hopefully) for an update on my roadmap!
