I'm trying to build this new version of my personal page, coming from an empty
Hugo-generated page to another empty Jekyll-generated one.
Why? Because I really love to change, changing the world, changing habits and so
on. But really, it is because I would like an easy tool with a familiar
interface. Probably Hugo was great, and for sure also Gatsby would be (another
intermediate failed attempt), but Jekyll its familiar, even if I'm mostly a
Python and not a Ruby programmer.

If I were able to desire something I would ask for a Jekyll version written in
python, so I can avoid all the Ruby installation and go for the usual and even
more familiar Python toolchain, but things are what they are, and paying the
price to install Ruby once (for each system installation, that are more
frequent than what I would like) it's not really so much expensive.
