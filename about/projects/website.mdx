Exactly this website, this is one of my main spare time projects during my first
year oh PhD.

## Technologies

I tried quite a few SSG, before finally landing on _Next.js_, in particular:

- Hugo
- Gatsby
- Jekyll

All of these were quite good, easy and fast enough for my needs, but every time
I would have liked to understand more, integrate more tools in the workflow, and
I spent some time to make a try.

My base request was that it should have been able to read simple markdown files
and produce a beautiful web page, in principle it was quite the only one, but
eventually I discovered it wasn't true.

I would have like to use `sass` for compiling my `css` with my favorite
framework, and properly produce and bundle `js` for my page, better using
`typescript`.
And then, why not, a proper framework, like `react` (not necessarily `react`),
and so the decision was quite clear: I didn't desire to have an easy vanilla SSG
at hand (while of course the easier the better), but my first requirement was a
proper complete tool I could use to learn web techs, and produce a modern
website with all the state of the art techniques.

`Next.js` was exactly what I needed.
