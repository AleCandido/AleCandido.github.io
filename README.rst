My Personal Page
================

My personal page built with Jekyll!

Contents
--------
- awesome home
- brief + long cv
  - brief to be visualizable in one screen (use all the space, so go for a landscape layout, instead of a portrait broken in more screen)
  - long style can be like https://github.com/team
- projects page 
    with projects presentation
     - one page with vertical layout and left/right aligned alternated banners like https://github.com/features/actions and https://github.com/enterprise, or more clean like https://github.com/about/careers
     - another page for browsing, with tag filters and so on (card layout, see https://bulma.io/documentation/components/card/, and for a complete layout search more GitHub and outside, its quite common)
  - cdt
  - human_dates
  - template projects
    - python template
    - jekyll template
  - dis (once public)
  - ...
- blog section
- "more" section
  - dotfiles
  - ricettario
  
Style
-----
Get inspiration by GitHub launch pages, you find them at the bottom of this page (of any GitHub page), and some more from `features <https://github.com/features>`_.

Theme Choice
------------

- bulma one: https://www.csrhymes.com/bulma-clean-theme/
- moon theme: http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/
- halve theme: https://taylantatli.github.io/Halve/
  - the most interesting part is the tiling layout for posts (access through
    the four boxes in the top right corner)
